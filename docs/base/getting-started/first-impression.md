# First impression

Well, are you ready for your journey? Before you continue with the guide, let's start by a quick overview to the project.

## What is MadMachine project?

Our project all focus on Swift language and microcontrollers. We would like to provide you with necessary hardware and software support to explore together the possibility of their combination.

Well, here's a little bit of background. You can surely skip this part if you'are quite familiar with it.

### Swift language

Let's first talk about [Swift language](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/). It is a programming language created by Apple. Nowadays, it's widely used for application development. Besides, many developers around the world are finding its possibilities in different filed, like server-side, etc. 

With many years' experience in electronics engineering, we strongly believe the huge potential of Swift on microcontroller world. As it's powerful, effecient and easy-to-learn, plus some unique features, the hardware programming can be more friendly and secure.


### Microcontroller

When it comes to microcontroller, many guys can have different definitions. In brief, you can take it as a small computer. You program it to receive or send data. We'll dive deeper into hardwares in section Learn.

Actually it is everywhere in our daily life, in keyboards, printers, microwave ovens, washing machines... and usually embedded in all kinds of devices. But the microcontrollers in them are programmed in advance to perform specific tasks and have limited functionalities. 

There are also some microcontrollers with more usages and can programmed by you to do mutilple tasks, with endless possibities, like our boards, [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/)...

### And then...

Yeah, they can now work together!!! You can write several lines of code to get some stuffs to work. 

You guys don't need to know complicated low-level stuffs, simply start with some example projects, no matter you have or don't have related knowledges.  


## What can I do with all boards?

There's endless possibilities... You can get inspiration from [instructable](https://www.instructables.com/circuits/projects/) and [hackster](https://www.hackster.io/projects?ref=topnav).

The principles of all kinds of projects are not that complicated. To sum up, your board get info from your surroundings, like light, temperature, sound, or your action like pressing a button, touching a screen. After it get the info, it will calculate the values and show it directly or by other ways like lighting, display, movement, sound, etc. Of course, what your board will do are all decided by your code.

:::note
After all, microcontrollers are not computers, you cannot expect them to do everything, especially some task that need heavy computing power.

## What do I need?

At first, you certainly need a hardware to work with. Our board family has two boards now: [SwiftIO board](../boards/swiftio-board.md) and [SwiftIO Feather board](../boards/swiftio-feather.md). They come with beginner kits to help you start. 

In order to program your board, you need to install the [MadMachine IDE](https://github.com/madmachineio/MadMachineIDE/releases/tag/v0.2.3-alpha). It allows you to edit, compile and download code. 

You will know more details later. Let's keep going.
