# Welcome

Welcome to the MadMachine! Excited to see you here!!!

Maybe you are not quite clear how all these stuffs work. Don't worry, let's find it out together.

To put it briefly, we focus on the usage of the Swift language on microcontrollers. That's to say, you can program your board in Swift language to control all kinds of hardwares, like LEDs, speakers, motors... or make them responsive to your actions. 


Never afraid if you have no prior experiences. You can follow the tutorials here to get started. 

- Docs - start from here to get familiar with the basic operations.

- Learn - then learn A to Z of electronics to understand better how everything works.

- Library - consult the documentation of APIs as you program your board.
