# How to use IDE

Now I will show you a brief introduction to MadMachine IDE. Here you can edit, build the code and download it to your board. It simplified the whole process, and thus everyone can get started easily.

## Create new project

When you first open the IDE, it will appear as follows. You need to click on **Create a new MadMachine project**. 



Then complete the project info.


- The Project name is _necessary_ for your project.
- Just keep the location as it is. The project folder will be created in the directory `Documents/MadMachine/Projects`. 


## Get familiar with IDE

    - ![add](img/add.jpeg)**New file**: create a new file for the current project.
