# Mission2_RGB_LED

After successfully get an LED to work, why not try more LEDs? In this project, let's build the circuit and make the LEDs blink one after another.

## What you need

The parts you will need are all included in the Maker kit.

- SwiftIO board
- Breadboard
- Red, green and blue LEDs
- Resistor
- Jumper wires


## Circuit


## Example code

```swift
import SwiftIO

// Import the board library to use the Id of the specific board.
import SwiftIOBoard

// Initialize three LEDs.
let red = DigitalOut(Id.D16)
let green = DigitalOut(Id.D17)
let blue = DigitalOut(Id.D18)

while true {
    // Turn on red LED for 1 second, then off.
    red.write(true)
    sleep(ms: 1000)
    red.write(false)

    // Turn on green LED for 1 second, then off.
    green.write(true)
    sleep(ms: 1000)
    green.write(false)

    // Turn on blue LED for 1 second, then off.
    blue.high()
    sleep(ms: 1000)
    blue.low()
}
```
