# Mission2_RGB_LED

After successfully get an LED to work, why not try more LEDs? In this project, let's build the circuit and make the LEDs blink one after another.

## What you need

The parts you will need are all included in the Maker kit.

- SwiftIO board
- Breadboard
- Red, green and blue LEDs
- Resistor
- Jumper wires


## Circuit

Let's know something about the breadboard first. You can find many holes in it. Actually, each upper or lower five sockets beside the gap in the middle are shorted vertically as shown above. So you could easily insert components into these holes.

Place three LEDs on the different columns.
The long leg of each LED connects to a digital pin: red LED connects to D16, green LED connects to D17, blue LED connects to D18.
The short leg is connected to a 1k ohm resistor and goes to the pin GND.
Note: the resistance of the resistor is not absolute, as long as it is bigger than the minimum requirement to resist the voltage. And the brightness of the LED is decided by the resistor: its resistance is higher, the LED will be dimmer.

BTW, you can usually find that the red jumper wires are for power, and the black ones are for ground.

## Example code

```swift
import SwiftIO

// Import the board library to use the Id of the specific board.
import SwiftIOBoard

// Initialize three LEDs.
let red = DigitalOut(Id.D16)
let green = DigitalOut(Id.D17)
let blue = DigitalOut(Id.D18)

while true {
    // Turn on red LED for 1 second, then off.
    red.write(true)
    sleep(ms: 1000)
    red.write(false)

    // Turn on green LED for 1 second, then off.
    green.write(true)
    sleep(ms: 1000)
    green.write(false)

    // Turn on blue LED for 1 second, then off.
    blue.high()
    sleep(ms: 1000)
    blue.low()
}
```


## Code analysis

```swift
import SwiftIO
import SwiftIOBoard
```
First, import the two libraries: [SwiftIO](https://swiftioapi.madmachine.io/) and [SwiftIOBoard](https://github.com/madmachineio/MadBoards/blob/main/Sources/SwiftIOBoard/Id.swift) to use everything it. SwiftIO is used to control the input and output of SwiftIO board. SwiftIOBoard defines the pin name of the board.

```swift
let red = DigitalOut(Id.D16)
let green = DigitalOut(Id.D17)
let blue = DigitalOut(Id.D18)
```
The [DigitalOut](https://swiftioapi.madmachine.io/Classes/DigitalOut.html) class allows you to set the pin to output high or low voltage. You need to initialize the three output pins: D16, D17, and D18 that the LEDs connect. Only after initialization, you could change their state.

```swift
while true {
}
```
To make the LED blinks repeatedly, you need to write the code in the dead loop `while true`. The code inside it could run all the time unless you power off the board.

```swift
red.write(true)
sleep(ms: 1000)
red.write(false)
```

In the loop, you will set three LEDs separately. The operations are similar. Let's look at the red LED.

At first, the pin outputs a high voltage to light the LED. Since each of the three LEDs connects to the digital pin and ground, they will be lighted as you apply a high voltage. After 1s, turn off the LED by applying low voltage. So the LED will be on for 1s and then be turned off.

The next LED turns on immediately and repeats the process above. Thus three LEDs blink in turns.



## Reference

[DigitalOut](https://swiftioapi.madmachine.io/Classes/DigitalOut.html) - set whether the pin output a high or low voltage.

[SwiftIOBoard](https://github.com/madmachineio/MadBoards/blob/main/Sources/SwiftIOBoard/Id.swift) - find the corresponding pin id of SwiftIO board.
