# Mission5_Buzzer





## What you need




## Circuit


## Example code

```swift
import SwiftIO

// Import the board library to use the Id of the specific board.
import SwiftIOBoard

let a0 = AnalogIn(Id.A0)

// PWM, also known as Pulse Width Modulation is a type of digital signal.
// The PWM signal can be used to configure a servo, or to control the dimming of a LED light.
// Initialize a PWM output pin.
let buzzer = PWMOut(Id.PWM2B)

while true {
    // Read the input voltage.
    let value = a0.readPercent()
    
    //let value = a0.readPercent()
    let frequency = Int(400 + 2000 * value) // calculate the float value into Int type to serve as frequency.
    buzzer.set(frequency: frequency, dutycycle: 0.5) // Set PWM parameters.
    sleep(ms: 20) // Set the duration of the notes.
}
```
