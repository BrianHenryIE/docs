# Tutorials

Welcome! After you run the first project on your board, you must want to try more projects. Now let's dive into the projects. 

In this section, you will learn with some simple projects. You can control your board to do many things and meanwhile learn some basic concepts.


There are three parts in total:

- **General** - get familiar with your board and simple usage of input and output. You will only use some commonly used components like a LED, button, buzzer. 

- **SwiftIO Maker kit** - use the modules in the maker kit to finish a dozen missions. You will use these components to build simple circuits and program to make them work together. 

- **SwiftIO Circuit Playgrounds** - start to learn electronics and programming with an all-in-one learning kit. You will progress on learning little by little, from some simple try with LED, button, to some advanced usage, like audio and screen display.
