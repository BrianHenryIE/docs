# Debounce

When you use a push button as a toggle switch, it often generates some flickering effects, due to mechanical and physical limitations, i.e. the processor may recognize the button being pushed several times in a short period of time. 

This example demonstrates how to debounce an input, which means checking twice in a short period of time to make sure the pushbutton is definitely being pressed and only pressed once.

## What you need

* SwiftIO board
* Button
* Jumper wires

## Circuit



## Code

You can find the example code at the bottom left corner of IDE: <img
  src={require('./img/example.png').default}
  alt="example" width="20"
/> / `SimpleIO` / `Debounce`.

```swift
// Check if the button is definitely pressed.
// Import the library to enable the relevant classes and functions.
import SwiftIO

// Import the board library to use the Id of the specific board.
import SwiftIOFeather

// Initialize the red onboard LED.
let red = DigitalOut(Id.RED)

// Initialize a digital input pin D0 the button is connected to.
let button = DigitalIn(Id.D0, mode: .pullUp)

// Declare the values in order to record and judge the button state.
var count = 0
var triggered = false


while true {
    // Read from the input pin.
    let value = button.read()
    
    // Ignore the change due to the noise.
    if value == false {
        count += 1
    } else {
        count = 0
        triggered = false
    }
    
    // Wait a certain period to check if the button is definitely pressed. 
    // Toggle the LED and then reset the value for next press.
    if count > 50 && !triggered {
        red.toggle()
        triggered = true
        count = 0
    }
    
    // Wait a millisecond and then read to ensure the current state last for enough time. 
    sleep(ms: 1)

}
```

## Instruction

### Debounce

Due to mechanical and physical issues, when you slowly press or release the button, there might be several contacts inside the button, so it often generates spurious open/close transitions when pressed or released. If you check the input state to directly determine the button state, these transitions may be read as multiple presses in a very short time. So you will need a debounce method.



This example demonstrates how to debounce an input, which means checking twice in a short period of time to make sure the pushbutton is definitely pressed. Without debouncing, pressing the button once may cause unpredictable results, like multiple LED state changes with just one press. 

### About code

Swift has a basic Boolean type, called Bool. Boolean values are referred to as logical, they can be either `true` or `false`. The variable`triggered` is define as Bool to store whether the digital input is change.

In this code, you will check the button state every millisecond. Since the noise signal won't last long, if the current button state lasts about 50 milliseconds, the button must come to a stable state, and then it's time to change the LED state.
