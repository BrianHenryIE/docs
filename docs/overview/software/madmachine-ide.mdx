# MadMachine for VS Code

This tool gives you an easy way to create new projects, build and download code. 

You can see steps 1 and 2 [here](../run-your-first-project) to install and set the extension.


The extension is at the bottom of the Explore panel. All you need for your project is these three buttons:

- **Build**: build your project after you finish the code. If there are any errors, you can modify your code according to the message in the terminal.
- **Download**: download the bin file generated after building your project.
- **New Project**: create a new MadMachine project. You will decide the project type and the board type.

The MadMachine extension comes with a serial extension called Serial Port Helper. [Here](../../how-to/debug#step-3-open-serial-monitor) is the instruction to use it. There are also many other serial tools you can find in the marketplace of extension. You can choose anyone you prefer.
